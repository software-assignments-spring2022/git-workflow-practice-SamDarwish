### Why I Like It:
Machine learning is, in my opinion, the only way forward in the field of generative music. 
Experimental music has always had a fascination with active interaction between the performer
and their instrument, and electronic music is no exception. Artists in the field describe 
their performance styles like conversations or dances between themselves and their computers,
and once we introduce machine learning, that conversation becomes much more in-depth.

The basic concept behind magenta is that you give the program a basic prompt, and,
informed by the level of unpredictability you decided and a few other factors, Magenta responds
with some MIDI data. MIDI is an electronic standard to which most modern synthesizers and samplers
conform, and it's how software synthezisers are controlled even within an entirely digital environment.
So, essentially, you ask Magenta for some music, and it gives you a sequence based on its own thinking.
This is a departure from past approaches to generative music in that it relies on much more
sophisticated thinking that goes beyond a simple algorithm, even one with purposeful randomness.

## Thanks!
